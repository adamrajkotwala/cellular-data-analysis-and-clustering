# cellular-data-analysis-and-clustering
Using Python (Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, etc.) to clean &amp; analyze nucleic data. The data I've worked with has genomic windows (DNA regions) as samples, and nuclear profiles (slices of individual mouse stem cell nuclei) as features. I implemented a k-means clustering algorithm to identify data subsets + habits of the histone locus body.
