# cellular-data-analysis-and-clustering
Using Python (Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, etc.) to clean &amp; analyze genomic data. The data I've worked with has genomic windows (DNA regions of the mouse's 13th chromosome) as samples, and nuclear profiles (slices of individual mouse stem cell nuclei) as features. I implemented a k-means clustering algorithm using a normalized jaccard distance measure to identify data subsets + potenital habits of the histone locus body. First, I explored the samples (nuclear profiles) but have now transposed the DataFrame and am exploring the features (genomic windows) using network science.
